# WDparams
WDparams is an open-source pipeline to measure the radial velocities, spectroscopic surface gravities and temperatures, and photometric radii and temperatures of all DA white dwarf stars confidently identified in Data Releases 1-16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and in the upcoming 19th Data Release of SDSS.
